To successfully import a Markdown file into Micro.blog, you should format it as follows:

1. Start with YAML frontmatter at the top of the file, enclosed by three dashes (---) on separate lines.

2. Include the following key fields in the frontmatter:

   - title: The title of your post
   - date: The publication date in YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+00:00 format
   - categories: A comma-separated list of categories (if any)

3. After the frontmatter, add your post content in Markdown format.

Here's an example of how your Markdown file should look:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2024-10-16T12:00:00+00:00
categories: category1, category2
---

Your post content goes here, written in Markdown format.

You can include **bold text**, *italics*, and other Markdown formatting.

## Subheadings are supported

And so are lists:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

When preparing your files for import, keep these points in mind:

1. Ensure your date format is correct, as Micro.blog is particular about this[1].

2. For categories, use a comma-separated string rather than a YAML array[2].

3. If you have images, make sure they are referenced with absolute URLs. Micro.blog will attempt to download and store these images with your blog during import[1].

4. You can include multiple Markdown files in a ZIP archive for bulk import[1].

5. If you want some posts to be drafts, place them in a folder named "drafts" within your ZIP file[1].

6. The maximum size for the ZIP file is 75 MB[1].

7. Micro.blog supports several frontmatter fields, including title, date, categories, tags, draft, and url[1].

By following these guidelines, you should be able to successfully import your Markdown files into Micro.blog.

Yes, you can import local images along with your Markdown files when importing to Micro.blog. Here's how to handle this:

1. Place your image files in the same directory as your Markdown files or in a subdirectory.

2. In your Markdown files, reference the images using relative paths. For example:

   ```markdown
   ![Image description](./images/my-image.jpg)
   ```

   Or if the image is in the same directory as the Markdown file:

   ```markdown
   ![Image description](my-image.jpg)
   ```

3. When preparing your import:

   - Create a ZIP file containing both your Markdown files and image files, maintaining the directory structure[1].
   - Ensure the image references in your Markdown files use relative paths as shown above.

4. During the import process, Micro.blog will:
   - Upload your Markdown files
   - Automatically detect image references in your Markdown content
   - Download and store the referenced images with your Micro.blog-hosted blog[1][2]

5. After import, Micro.blog will update the image references in your posts to point to the newly stored images on their servers.

Important notes:

- Don't include the images in a separate ZIP file. They should be in the same ZIP as your Markdown files[1].
- The maximum size for the ZIP file is 75 MB[1].
- If your image references use absolute URLs, make sure to add your domain name when importing[1].
- For Hugo sites, if you have images in a content/posts folder or elsewhere, the importer should be able to handle this structure[2].

By following these steps, you can successfully import both your Markdown content and associated local images into Micro.blog.

title: "Theresa May on the Salisbury Novichok Attack"
tags: [Politics, UK, Novichok]
date: 2024-10-17

Theresa May gets it right here. It was appalling that Putin tried to assassinate someone on British soil, and it was just unbelievable that they didn't care about who else got poisoned.

"May said the men acted with “utter recklessness”. She said: “You felt they just didn’t care about anything.”

how could I include photos?

To include photos in your Micro.blog post using the API, you'll need to upload the images first, get their URLs, and then include those URLs in your content. Here's how you can do it:

Upload the Photo: Send a POST request to the Micro.blog API to upload your photo. This will give you a URL for the uploaded image.

Include the Photo URL in Your Content: Once you have the URL, you can include it in your post content using Markdown.

Here's a PowerShell script example to walk you through both steps:

Step 1: Upload the Photo

```
# Define the photo file path and API endpoint
$photoFilePath = 'path_to_your_photo.jpg'
$url = 'https://micro.blog/media'

# Read the photo file
$photoBytes = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($photoFilePath)

# Define headers
$headers = @{
    'Authorization' = 'Bearer <your-app-token>'
}

# Upload the photo
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $photoBytes -ContentType 'multipart/form-data'

# Extract the URL of the uploaded photo
$photoUrl = $response.url
```

Step 2: Include the Photo URL in Your Post

# Read the content from the text file
$content = Get-Content -Path 'your_text_file_with_yaml.txt' -Raw

# Append the photo URL to your content in Markdown format
$content += "`n`n![Photo]($photoUrl)"

# Define the API endpoint and headers
$postUrl = 'https://micro.blog/micropub'
$headers = @{
    'Authorization' = 'Bearer <your-app-token>'
    'Content-Type'  = 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
}

# Define the body of the request
$body = @{
    h       = 'entry'
    content = $content
}

# Send the POST request to create the post
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $postUrl -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body

# Output the response
$response
```

    content = $content
}

# Send the POST request to create the post

# Output the response
$response
```
Replace <your-app-token>, path_to_your_photo.jpg, and your_text_file_with_yaml.txt with your actual token, photo file path, and text file path. This script will upload your photo to Micro.blog and create a new post with the image included.
